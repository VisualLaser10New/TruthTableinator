## Working method
This code is to be upgraded: the code doesn't check if the equations are syntactically correct, doesn't check if the variables names are too long or some bugs like that.
The main.c contains all surface functions, instead the "library" boolean_parsers provides functions to parse the boolean expressions.
In main function are an example of using as truthtable generator.
